## 2. Advanced On-Page SEO Implementation
Each page must be technically perfect for search crawlers.

### A. Title & Meta Optimization
- **Rule**: Unique, keyword-rich titles (50-60 chars) and meta descriptions (150-160 chars) for every page.
- **Action**: Already implemented in Phase 1; continuous monitoring required.

### B. Header Hierarchy (H1-H3)
- **H1**: Must contain the primary keyword (e.g., "Automated **Social Media Management** Systems").
- **H2**: Should address high-intent questions (e.g., "Why **Social Media Automation** Matters for Your Business").
- **H3**: Feature specific benefits or features (e.g., "24/7 **Content Distribution**").

### C. Content Depth & LSI
- **Target**: 800-1,200 words per subsystem page.
- **Action**: Expand current placeholder content with deep, authoritative insights into how each system works specifically for the African context.

---

## 3. Technical SEO & Schema Markup
Providing search engines with structured data to understand your services.

### A. JSON-LD Implementation
- **Service Schema**: Define each subsystem as a `Service` provided by `Zinara Digital`.
- **FAQ Schema**: Mark up the FAQ sections to enable rich snippets in Google search results.
- **Course Schema**: For AI Training pages, use `Course` schema to display training modules in search results.

### B. URL Architecture
- **Current**: `/services/seo.html`
- **Optimization**: Ensure all internal links use these clean, descriptive URLs.
- **Sitemap**: Generate and submit a `sitemap.xml` to Google Search Console.

---

## 4. Internal Linking & Authority Silos
Creating a "Silo" structure to pass authority from the home page to subsystems.

### A. Footer Navigation (Implemented)
- Every page links to every subsystem, ensuring 100% crawlability.

### B. Contextual Linking
- **Action**: Add internal links within the text of main section pages (e.g., `digital-marketing.html`) that point directly to their respective subsystem pages (e.g., `seo.html`).

### C. Breadcrumb Navigation
- **Action**: Add breadcrumbs (e.g., `Home > Marketing > SEO Strategy`) to internal pages to help crawlers understand the site hierarchy.

---

## 5. Performance & User Experience (UX)
Search engines favor pages that load fast and work on all devices.

### A. Mobile Optimization (Implemented)
- All pages are 100% responsive.

### B. Core Web Vitals
- **Action**: Optimize image sizes and use WebP format where possible.
- **Action**: Ensure the "90-second response" promise is reflected in page performance metrics.
